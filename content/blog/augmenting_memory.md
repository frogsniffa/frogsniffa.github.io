Anki is a software that schedules flashcard reviews for you. Writing flashcards on Desktop and reviewing them on your phone is a simple but effective way to improve your standard of living. Anki facilitates synoptic reading, or deeply reading keystone papers and skimming good ones in a new field, by solidifying background concepts.

What do you put on Anki flashcards? You put anything you're afraid you'll forget your understanding of. What happens if something you Ankify has questionable validity? You can Ankify its source and why it's difficult to convert the questionable statement into something true.

Anything is worth Ankifying if it took brain latency to reach an understanding and you need to reunderstand it. Anki questions should have one single responsibility or you risk excessively reviewing something you partially know. Don't Ankify islands. Use multiple variants of the same question.

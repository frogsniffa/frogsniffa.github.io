My partner and I got off the spaceship. I forgot what they looked like with their forgettable face. They were the pilot of a Millennium Falcon with black protruding spikes. The spikes, ugly as they were, were for grabbing onto when going outside after facing heavy winds. It was chaos on top of the colosseum we landed on. Half the place was on fire. The colosseum was half destroyed. Dragons littered the sky. As we observed our surroundings, a giant dragon successfully fireballed our spaceship. With nowhere to go, we jumped into the center of the colosseum where an ocean broke our fall.

This dragon was our rival who tried to kill us in many ways before. It followed us when it transformed into a monster, its head replaced by a mouth with no eyes, and its appearance morphed into a black crocodile with a small body. We had visited this planet before and by deja vu had realized we'd already encountered the same monster.

We swam and opened the entrance of the colosseum. Inside, people were just trying to escape from monsters. I theorized this place was the home of humanity as we had not seen a single person before and now the entire world was at our doorstep. The monster from before tried to eat us but our desire to not die propelled us to outmaneuver it every time. The monsters roaming around just ate people whenever they felt like it. We were in a constant state of terror.

Time suddenly sped up so fast around us. It was an indescribable feeling but our own eyes could validate it as we saw the space around us empty at increasing rates and the amount of zig-zagging people shrink before our eyes. It was like living in a timelapse. We then overheard a monster complain that it wasn't socially acceptable to straightforwardly eat people anymore. We realized, by instinct, that we could stop fleeing our monster. Some invisible rule protected us and without understanding why we reaped its benefits first. It was only later that the cause caught up to us. The monster had simply noticed when people were scarce, they were more valuable. Value was protected by invisible rules leading to bureaucracy.

As people became more valuable, monsters were more creative in how they hunted. Zombs, a VALORANT pro, was a surviving human and I saw him agree to a card game with a monster for odds. Had he lost, he would've allowed himself to have been eaten. Zombs declared red of hearts. He drew three cards from the deck and one was a red of hearts. The monster drew three cards and also got a red of hearts. Zombs then drew another red of hearts after a three card draw. His life was spared but he would've lost had he not been lucky his last turn. The monster bitched and revealed he last ate a stupid girl who was a tattoo artist who knew her wrong name her whole life and as a result, he was very dissatisfied in the stomach.

People began to have leisure time and exploited their increasing lifespan and environment's quickened passage of time for entertainment. It became popular to watch sped-up edits of dogs over millennia. A girly pop entertainer would edit the most basic videos but the fact that it'd change in uncommonly thought of ways over time would no longer make it boring. A new age of entertainment ushered in.

I then woke up without having seen the ending of a dog video.

## Summary

Contrasting the toxic positivity of the 21st century, the Cold War marked clear boundaries between Other vs. Same. The tiniest of ideas crossing imaginary boundaries were rejected like an immune system defending against a virus. The 21st century no longer marks boundaries, which have been broken down by excess consumption. The news, traditionally the ideological enforcer of boundaries, is vestigial as their perceived threats have downgraded to annoyances. Toxic positivity cannot be modeled immunologically as it's violent but not hostile. It flexes its force in an invisible way because it's immanent in the system. Moreover, overproduction, overachievement, and overcommunication do not provoke strong immunological responses but rather rejection. Depression, ADHD, and burnout are symptoms of the ego overheating from Same exposure.

Contrasting the free-to-achieve-as-much-as-possible auto-exploitation society of today, the 20th century and prior hinged on allo-exploitation. Because discipline is only so effective, to maximize and accelerate productivity, society began to ask for favors via Can vs. Should. Depression results when one defines their own success and fails to meet it. One's burnt-out mentality of "nothing is possible" contrasts toxic positivity society's idea that "nothing is impossible".

Savage animals concentrate on chaos to survive. They are not capable of higher thinking. Toxic positivity, not filtering through enough stimuli, regresses society to animality. Though boredom is how momentous strides in culture were advanced, like for example, someone bored of walking discovered dancing, we seek to eliminate boredom at any cost. Modern gaming produces rushes of dopamine which always feel the same. In contrast, deep contemplation doesn't get old. Hyperfixation on achieving instead of immersing is also ironically making society less productive. Pervasive, incessant skepticism hampers our ability to focus. Finally, a way in which we find meaning in our lives is through a sense of narrative, like how we inaccurately remember and describe histories. The sense of continuity diminishes.

Cicero through Cato absolutizes the vita contemplativa. Heidegger and Arendt instead praise the vita activa: Heidegger, restrictingly, because of memento mori, and Arendt, freeingly, because of natality. But she notes the rise of animal laborans or beasts of burdens ruining the full potential of vita activa by concentrating acting on laboring. Animal laborans, she hypothesizes, has emergent properties, for the concentration of an animal laborans acting on acting as a group births an organism viewed far away. However, her prediction of animal laborans was not correct according to Han. He agrees on the ubiquity of animal laborans but that's about it. He thinks the modern animal laborans is hyper anxious instead of obedient. They're individualistic instead of collectivistic, which, may've been Arendt's ideal vision of vita activa. They lack religion and a narrative for thanatotechnics, so as Nietzsche saw, they're hypochondriacs. The preservation of life is quasi-religious. Modern individuals have lost the capacity for the vita contemplativa, which explains the rise of abundant neuroses.

*Friendly Ambitious Nerd* (FAN) is a set of life advice seemingly written in a single take. I attempt to compress the novel parts of it.

"Why did you pause after you said ...?" is an example of listening intently. "What is the history of your x taste?" is a goated conversation starter. There needs to be more tips for the giver side of the giver-taker model of friendship.

Friendships fall apart after they have too much technical debt. The cost of explaining what's wrong becomes too burdened. Whether to fix this or move on depends on whether you agree that the law of diminishing returns applies to friendships.

Your social life has a shadow world. Bob is an asshole 52% of the time but he's never an asshole *around you*. You'll never figure that out by only relying on your POV.

Any argument supposes an oversimplified context. When arguing with others, make an attempt to understand their context. Debate seems to apply well to the real world but its ugly cousin of determining whether to do it by analyzing contexts is just as important.
